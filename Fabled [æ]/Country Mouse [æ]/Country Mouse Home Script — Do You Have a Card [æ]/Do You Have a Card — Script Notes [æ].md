The Country Mouse / Marionette jinx interacts with the Balloonist / Marionette jinx! Make sure to follow both.

## Jinxes on Script
Country Mouse / Marionette
> If the Marionette is in the bag but did not count towards Country Mouse, the Marionette cannot affect the Outsider count.

Balloonist / Marionette
> If the Marionette thinks that they are the Balloonist, +1 Outsider might have been added.

## Watch What Happens on Balloonist+

The [Balloonist](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Balloonist) is scary for the evil team with Country Mouse in play, and they know it!
The Balloonist can be confident that ***at most*** one other Outsider-mod character was in the bag and has means to find Outsiders.

This makes Balloonist potent both in information and as bluff. Effectively, Balloonist is both a YSK and ongoing info with Country Mouse in play. Be sure to take this into consideration when bag building!

## Hermit and the Outsiders

Ah, [Hermit](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Hermit)... Often scared out of their mind on every script, the adrenaline from pulling the lighthouse can be tough. Country Mouse throws the poor fellow a boon: they start knowing crucial information. The Hermit can be sure ***at most*** one other Outsider-mod character was in the bag, just like Balloonist.

[Recluse](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Recluse), [Sweetheart](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Sweetheart), and [Barber](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Barber) serve as augments for Hermit. The Sweetheart, Barber, and the [Fang Gu](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Fang_Gu) encourage the Hermit to quieten down and soak in their starting information. Recluse casts doubt on any particularly vocal Hermits, leaving them exposed. Together, this allows evil to bluff Hermit effectively with greater options: they can choose to loudly claim it on the block, they can hide and use it as alibi for suspicious behaviour, et cetera.

Town has to come to a decision, but there are too many questions. Is the Hermit real, and can we eliminate worlds? If we execute them, do we get a drunk player and an escaping Demon? What if they’re a [Boomdandy](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Boomdandy)? If we don’t, does that pesky Witch continue to curse?

Who knows. Certainly not me!

## My Fellow Minions in the Typhon Line and Me

[Xaan](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Xaan) can coexist with Balloonist and Hermit! It takes just one small trick in Country Mouse’s wording: *“in the bag”*. You don’t put the Xaan token in the bag in a [Lord of Typhon](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Lord_of_Typhon) game, do you? It serves our needs particularly interestingly; Lord of Typhon and Xaan are the only arbitrary Outsider-mod on this script, so pairing them together doesn’t impede the Outsider count solve all that much.
