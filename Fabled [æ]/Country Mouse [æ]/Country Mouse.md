### Overview
The Country Mouse wrangles games with a high amount of Outsider-modifying characters on script.
- Characters that can change Outsider count write so in setup brackets.
- **[+2 Outsiders]**, **[-1 Outsider]**, **[+1 or -1 Outsiders]**, **[+? to -? Outsiders]**, et cetera.

### How to Run
At the start of the game, declare that the Country Mouse is in play. Add the Country Mouse token to the Grimoire.

When setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, ensure that only two Outsider-modifying roles are in play.

### Examples
The script has [**Balloonist**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Balloonist), [**Godfather**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Godfather), and [**Vigormortis**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Vigormortis). Only two of these roles can be in the bag, so the Storyteller only adds Balloonist and Godfather into the bag with a total of +2 Outsiders.

The script has Balloonist, [**Baron**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Baron), and [**Fang Gu**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Fang_Gu). Only two of these roles can be in the bag, so the Storyteller only adds Balloonist and Baron into the bag with a total +2 Outsiders, with Balloonist contributing +0 Outsiders.

The game starts with a [**Kazali**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Balloonist). The Kazali creates a Godfather. This is fine: it did not affect setup. The [**Pit-Hag**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Pit-Hag) changes a Minion into the [**Xaan**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Xaan). This is fine: it did not affect setup. The [**Plague Doctor**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Xaan) dies, and the Storyteller gains the [**Baron**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Baron) ability. This is fine: it did not affect setup.

### Jinxes
[**Sentinel**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Sentinel)
> If the Sentinel is in play, it also counts as being “in the bag”.

[**Marionette**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Marionette)
> If the Marionette is in the bag but did not count towards Country Mouse, the Marionette cannot affect the Outsider count.

### Clarifications and Tips
[**Huntsman**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Huntsman) *( [+[Damsel](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Damsel)] )* and
[**Legion**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Legion) *( technically [+? to -? Outsiders] )*
are optionally counted as characters that control Outsider count at setup.

Same for [**Atheist**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Atheist) *( [whatever. Go my rulebreak] )* but that one doesn’t matter as much, does it?
