## Country Mouse (Fabled)
> Characters might wake in a different order. All players know the details.

*“So he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes and in the marshes.”*

### Overview
The Envious Raven allows for the Storyteller or script writer to rearrange the order that charcaters wake.
- Do not use the Envious Raven to haphazardly scramble the waking order. Characters wake in an order for a reason.
- Script writers may request a specific order the characters wake in. Follow this order.
- You may also use Envious Raven to rearrange waking order to alleviate meta. You should declare that you will be doing this, and it should not mechanically change the game.

### How to Run
When designing the scripts you will pass out before the game, you may edit the Night Order section to change the waking order.

Before the game, declare that the Envious Raven is in play, and mention the changes. 

### Examples
The script has [**Balloonist**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Balloonist), [**Godfather**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Godfather), and [**Vigormortis**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Vigormortis). Only two of these roles can be in the bag, so the Storyteller only adds Balloonist and Godfather into the bag with a total of +2 Outsiders.

The script writer has requested for the [**Snake Charmer**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Snake_Charmer) to wake before Demon Info. This is a completely original idea which has never been done before. 

The Storyteller does not like meta. He declares that after the first night, players will wake in the order: [**Philosopher**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Philosopher) → [**Snake Charmer**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Snake_Charmer) → Minions → the Demon → Other Good Characters → [**Mathematician**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Mathematician). On the second night, a [**Juggler**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Juggler) wakes before the [**Flowergirl**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Flowergirl). On the third night, a [**Pit-Hag**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Pit-Hag) wakes before the [**Witch**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Witch), and an [**Oracle**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Oracle) wakes before a [**Dreamer**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Dreamer).

### Jinxes
